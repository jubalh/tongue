# tongue #

tongue is a command line based vocabulary manager.
It lets you easily add, remove, show and list entries from your collection.
The collection is saved in simple, human readable JSON format.

I was looking for a beginner project to learn go, so I created this. I use it more than I thought I would :-)

# Usage #

`tongue --help` should be enough to teach you how to use tongue.
